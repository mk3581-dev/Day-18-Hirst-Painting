# 🎨 Hirst Painting Project (Day 18 – Python Turtle)

This project is part of **Day 18** of **Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**.  
It recreates a **Damien Hirst–style dot painting** using Python’s **Turtle Graphics** module.

The program draws a grid of evenly spaced, randomly colored dots to generate a modern art–style painting.

---

## 📌 Project Preview

The output consists of:
- A 10 × 10 grid of dots
- Each dot having:
  - Equal size
  - Equal spacing
  - Random color from a predefined RGB color list

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

This project reinforces the following Python concepts:

- Turtle Graphics
- Loops (`for`)
- Conditional statements (`if`)
- RGB color handling
- Randomization
- Screen positioning & coordinates
- Clean code structure

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **turtle** (built-in module)
- **random** (built-in module)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The turtle starts at the bottom-left of the screen.
2. It draws one dot at a time using a random RGB color.
3. After every 10 dots, the turtle moves up to the next row.
4. The process repeats until a 10 × 10 grid is complete.
